            <h3> Marketing Manager, blogger & amateur web developer </h3>
        
            <p>When I was 16, I started to write regular articles for the specialtake.com blog which was dedicated to upholding special views on every matter including social trends, scientific inventions, business, tech, environment, and a lot more.
                I had no plans to carry on with professional writing but I loved playing around with words so much that I ended up as a freelance blogger and content writer. Over time, I learned and developed SEO skills to help my clients rank on search engines, engage readers on the websites, and achieve their marketing goals. 
               I chose to move forward toward growth and sought the next professional frontier to explore my full potential and capability. I joined an ABM agency as a Social Media Intern and jumped on the bandwagon of digital marketing and advertising.  
               Currently, as the Marketing Manager at California Web makers, I’m responsible for researching and implementing marketing and advertising strategies on various social media platforms Facebook, Linked In, Twitter, and Instagram, and executing email marketing campaigns. 
               I'm always seraching for new challenges, hence, I learned web development and looking to build my career in the programming industry as well.

<h1>Dream Big</h1>
<h>Never Stop honing your skills</h3>
<p>My most exciting work to date was executing and testing SEM/PPC campaigns on Google Ads with my fellow teammates which delivered consistent top-of-the-funnel traffic growth for one of our California Web Makers agency Jewelry business clients and contributed to revenue increase of 12%, leading the team to record-breaking sales and marketing results for the year! 
    Hence, “all work and no play” is not in my dictionary. I’m fond of Football games and never miss any league matches of Bayern Munich, Juventus, Chelsea, and the German national team. As a football enthusiast, I analyze and review football games on Facebook and YouTube channel “The Game of Goats”. 
   I’ve got easy to get along persona and am always eager to connect with other professionals. While I enjoy all aspects of my job, I think my favorite stage of a project is working with the business unit leader or client to understand his or her business objectives, visions, and missions. As we go through that collaborative process, the ideas start to flow, new challenges come up and that’s always the fun part.
